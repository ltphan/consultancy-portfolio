  `I designed and developed a blog that specializes in F1 motorsport
            gossip magazine for women, creating a responsive digital publication
            that brings the excitement of Formula 1 to a female audience. The
            platform features a clean, visually engaging interface that blends
            racing news with lifestyle elements.`,
  `I revamped and redesigned the Brex mobile application for enterprise customers, focusing on
            critical expense management features including streamlined account
            creation and detailed card transaction tracking. The app serves as a
            cornerstone financial tool that helped secure enterprise deals with
            companies like Coinbase and DoorDash.`,
  `I built and launched Clio's first consumer product during COVID-19,
            creating essential remote collaboration capabilities between lawyers
            and their clients when in-person meetings weren't possible. This
            strategic innovation opened a new market opportunity and solidified
            Clio's position as a legal tech leader, serving over 600,000+
            clients.`,
  `  I led the comprehensive revamp and redesign of Clio's flagship
            mobile application for both iOS and Android platforms. I implemented
            critical features including case details management, transaction
            tracking, and secure PDF document uploading, transforming the user
            experience. This redesign dramatically increased app store ratings
            from 2.3 to 4.8, garnering over 6,000+ positive reviews and
            significantly enhancing the digital workflow for 150,000+ legal
            professionals.`,
