            creating essential remote collaboration capabilities between lawyers
            and their clients when in-person meetings weren't possible. This
            strategic innovation opened a new market opportunity and solidified
            Clio's position as a legal tech leader, serving over 600,000+
            clients.

            I led the comprehensive revamp and redesign of Clio's flagship

            critical features including case details management, transaction
            tracking, and secure PDF document uploading, transforming the user
            experience. This redesign dramatically increased app store ratings
            from 2.3 to 4.8, garnering over 6,000+ positive reviews and
            significantly enhancing the digital workflow for 150,000+ legal
